# Image Compression with Quadtree
Image Compression with Quadtree is a technique that compresses an image by recursively subdividing it into smaller blocks. If a block has uniform or similar pixel values, it is stored as a single unit. This method reduces the amount of data needed to represent the image while maintaining its essential structure. Quadtree compression is efficient and can be implemented using brute force or heuristic-based approaches.
